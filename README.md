I created this project to step into the mindset of a Senior Analyst, Compensation and explore how data can help solve real compensation challenges at American Airlines. I used Python to analyze simulated employee pay data and uncover issues like internal equity gaps, regional pay inconsistencies, and contract wage shortfalls. Writing the code helped me not only automate the analysis but also make it repeatable, clear, and easy to scale.

The charts were my way of visualizing the story behind the numbers. Things like how tenure impacts pay, where pay bands might be off, or how far contract roles fall below living wage standards. To pull everything together, I built a presentation deck just like I would if I were presenting to HR or business leaders. It summarizes the insights and offers actionable recommendations, showing how Iâ€™d bring both analytical thinking and strategic perspective to the role.
